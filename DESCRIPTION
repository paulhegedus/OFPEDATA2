Title: On-Farm Precision Experiments Demo Data
Description: This package contains example data related to the On-Farm 
    Precision Experiments (OFPE) project at Montana State University. This data
    is used to demonstrate the usage of the OFPE Tools R-package in the 
    associated vignettes of that package. It contains field and farm boundaries
    as well as raw data collected on farms. This data is primarily used to show
    users how to set up their OFPE formatted PostgreSQL database in the first 
    step of the OFPE data workflow. See the OFPE Tools package for more 
    information and links to further resources.
