# OFPEDATA
This package contains example data related to the On-Farm Precision Experiments (OFPE) project at Montana State University. This data is used to demonstrate the usage of the OFPE Tools R-package in the associated vignettes of that package. It contains field and farm boundaries as well as raw data collected on farms. This data is primarily used to show users how to set up their OFPE formatted PostgreSQL database in the first step of the OFPE data workflow. See the OFPE Tools package for more information and links to further resources. OFPE Tools Github: https://github.com/paulhegedus/OFPE.git
